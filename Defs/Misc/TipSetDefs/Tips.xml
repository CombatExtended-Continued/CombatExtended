    <tips>
      <!-- Interface-->
	<!--<li>You can set loadouts for pawns.</li>-->
		
      <!-- Combat -->
		<li TKey="MortarSquad">The most important part of a mortar squad is an experienced spotter with a good pair of binoculars.</li>
		<li TKey="LessConscious">If your colonists can't hit the broad side of a barn, perhaps they are vision-impaired, less conscious or they weren't told to aim their shots.</li>
		<li TKey="KillZone">Fewer things are deadlier than a well-prepared kill zone.</li>		
		<li TKey="ReusableProjectiles">Simple, durable projectiles such as steel or plasteel arrows can survive the force of impact to be re-used by you or your enemies.</li>
		<li TKey="Stabilize">Select a colonist carrying medicine and right click a downed comrade (or foe) to order them to "stabilize" the target, temporarily stanching their bleeding.</li>
		<li TKey="Stabilizing">Stabilizing someone temporarily staunches their bleeding, but it does not treat the wound. How long it lasts depends on the medic's skill and the medicine quality.</li>
		<li TKey="FatalBloodloss">Bloodloss is often as fatal as enemy fire. Tend to the wounded quickly to save allies and capture foes.</li>
		<li TKey="WeaponWithShield">Some weapons, such as one-handed pistols and melee weapons, can be used in conjuction with a shield, although doing so will expose the user's arms.</li>
		<li TKey="ExtremelyCentipedes">Centipedes are extremely well armored mechanoids, intended to shrug off small arms fire and break defensive lines. Defeating them requires special weapons and tactics.</li>
		<li TKey="StockpileAmmo">Stockpiling ammunition close to your emplacements keeps it handy during combat. Just watch out for cook-off!</li>
		<li TKey="ShootersDarkness">Targets are more difficult to spot in darkness, but shooters aren't penalized for being in the dark. Light 'em up!</li>
	<!--<li>If either shooter or target is unroofed in bad weather, accuracy diminishes.</li>-->
	<!--<li>Any dense smoke in the way of a shooter and their target has detrimental effects on accuracy.</li>-->
	<!--<li>Targets in dense smoke may experience negative health effects without a gas mask. At least they become more difficult to hit.</li>-->
		<li TKey="GoodSights">Good sights can help negate inaccuracy due to bad weather, darkness, or dense smoke.</li>
		<li TKey="ProjectilesDodge">Shooters imperfectly lead their targets until they commit to a shot. Slower projectiles can be dodged.</li>
		<li TKey="ReloadedOneRound">Some weapons, such as shotguns, are often reloaded one round at a time, allowing them to be fired mid-reload.</li>
		<li TKey="ForceImpact">Even when a projectile doesn't penetrate a character's armor, they may still be injured by the force of the impact.</li>
		<li TKey="SaveHead">Even when behind cover, a shooter's head will still be exposed as they scan for targets.</li>
		<li TKey="RiskOfInfection">The longer a wound remains untreated, the higher the risk of infection. Lying in the dirt doesn't help things either.</li>
		<li TKey="SuppressFire">The Suppress fire mode will let shooters continue to engage targets even if they lose sight of them while firing.</li>
		<li>Darkness seriously impacts ranged weapon accuracy, especially at longer ranges. Offset this with night vision equipment, bionics or by illuminating your target with flares.</li>
		<li>Night vision of different types doesn't stack, but shooters will always use the best source of night vision available to them.</li>
		<li>Pawns with enough weapon handling stat can target specific body parts for quickest or safest takedowns.</li>
		<li>Attackers and friendlies may take advantage of loaded guns and ammunition scattered around battlefields.</li>
		<li>Muzzle flash from firing guns will reveal the shooter in the darkness making them easier to spot and therefore be shot by others.</li> 

	  <!-- Melee -->	
		<li>Your chance to hit, parry, dodge or land a critical hit in melee is a comparison between your and the enemy skill. The higher the difference in skill levels, the bigger the disparity.</li>
		<li>Your choice of weapon significantly affects your chance to hit, parry, dodge or land a critical hit.</li>
		<li>Melee weapons can score critical hits. Blunt weapons will inflict a short stun, sharp weapons double their armor penetration, and animals knock down their target.</li>
		<li>Heavy, blunt melee weapons may defeat thick armor when edged weapons fail.</li>
		<li>Scoring a critical hit on a parry gives you a free riposte attack.</li>
		<li>Pawns with enough melee skill can target specific body parts for quickest or safest takedowns.</li>
		
	  <!-- Suppression -->	
		<li>Characters under enemy fire will become suppressed, diminishing their effectiveness in combat. Under especially heavy fire, they will seek cover and hunker down to avoid being killed.</li>
		<li>Projectiles will suppress enemies along their entire trajectory. Keep your spacing!</li>		
		<li>Suppressed characters are indicated with a yellow downwards arrow. Suppression incurs mood debuffs, prevents aiming shots, and lowers accuracy.</li>
		<li>Hunkering characters emit an orange downwards arrow and dive for the nearest cover, where they build courage to return to the fight.</li>
		<li>Armor and specialized items like war masks make characters less suceptible to supression.</li>
		
	  <!-- Items & Weapons -->
		<li>Armor-piercing ammo offers superior armor penetration, but less damage than FMJ. The reverse is true for Hollow-Points.</li>	  
		<li>Shotguns can fire a variety of special ammunition types, such as EMP and non-lethal beanbags.</li>
		<li>Guns vary in calibre, accepted ammo types, long-range accuracy and magazine size. Find out more by reading their information tab!</li>
		<li>Thick armour instills courage against small arms fire, but its bulkiness reduces work speed.</li>
		<li>You can rely on enemies to drop ammunition, or you can craft it yourself at a machining table or a loading bench.</li>
		<li>Prometheum can be harvested from Blazebulb plants to create powerful incendiary weapons. But beware, high temperatures will cause Blazebulbs to combust!</li>		
		<li>FSX, a volatile compound used to manufacture various explosives, can be harvested by butchering or shearing boomalopes and boomrats, or can be synthesized from chemfuel at a drug lab or biofuel refinery.</li>
		<li>Cold climates benefits are favourable for growing blazebulbs, where less cooling is required to prevent them from combusting.</li>
		<li>Warm climates benefits are favorable for rearing boomalopes and boomrats, which struggle in harsh winter conditions.</li>
		<li>Prometheum-based flamethrowers and Molotovs will soak their targets and cause even normally non-flammable enemies to burn fiercely.</li>
		<li>Incendiary mortar shells will airburst and set fire to large areas.</li>
		<li>Prometheum is a self-igniting liquid that sticks to surfaces and is impossible to extinguish without firefoam.</li>
		<li>It's not just carried items that count against your colonists' carry weight. Clothes and armor slow them down too.</li>
		<li>Colonists wearing bulky clothing or carrying bulky equipment will work more slowly and be less effective in melee combat.</li>
		<li>Certain guns like machine guns and sniper rifles have bipods built into them for you to take advantage of. Beware that while guns can be fired without setting up their bipods, they will suffer a penalty to their accuracy.</li>

	  <!-- Features -->
		<li>Precipitation, wind direction and speed all have a significant effect on fire spread. Beware of being downwind from a bush fire.</li>
		<li>Fires in confined spaces will create clouds of lethal smoke, capable of rapidly incapacitating anyone caught in it. Use gas masks to protect yourself.</li>
		<li>Use loadouts to determine what your colonists should carry in their inventory. Use the equipment tab to access items.</li>
		<li>In a pinch, you can order your colonists to give ammo to other friendly pawns.</li>
	  
	  <!-- Building -->
		<li>Embrasures provide a safer, but not impenetrable, cover to lay down machinegun fire on assailants. Be sure to wear a helmet when peeking over them!</li>
		<li>Auto-turrets can be built by a constructor or bought from traders or settlements. They will target and fire automatically when powered, but must be reloaded manually.</li>
		<li>Manned turrets can be built by constructors or bought from traders or settlements. They will target and fire automatically when manned by a pawn, but must be reloaded manually.</li>
