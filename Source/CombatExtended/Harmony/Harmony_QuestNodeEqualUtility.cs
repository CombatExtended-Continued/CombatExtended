     * This occurs when value1 contains a ThingDef with a custom class (such as CombatExtended.AmmoDef), and value2 contains a
     * string identifier for a ThingDef. Due to how Verse.ConvertHelper is set up, it assumes that strings can always be converted
     * to any object class, which isn't the case with the TradeRequest quest, where value1 will potentially load a CE ammo def,
     * and value2 contains a string identifier for ThingDef.Leather_Human. As the latter can't be cast into CombatExtended.AmmoDef,
     * the error occurs on database lookup.
     * Issue has been mentioned to Ludeon to verify whether this is something to be fixed on their end.
     * For now, the prefix below will prevent the error.
