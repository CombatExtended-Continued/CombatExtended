    /* Dev Notes:
     * on a high level need to make the following changes.
     * From:
     *  float single = 0.2f;
     * To:
     *  float single = 1f;
     * From:
     *  single = single * Mathf.Clamp01(1f - hediffCompTendDuration.tendQuality);
     * To: (Decided to make this a call rather than try and patch with specifics, easier to maintain/tweak)
     *  single = Mathf.Clamp01(chance / Mathf.Pow(hediffCompTendDuration.tendQuality + 0.75f, 2));
     *
     * Plan to make the first change as part of the patch.
     * The second change will remove the original code (so remove single * Mathf.Clamp01 (etc...))
     *  and instead assign single the value from a function call for easier tweaking in the future.
