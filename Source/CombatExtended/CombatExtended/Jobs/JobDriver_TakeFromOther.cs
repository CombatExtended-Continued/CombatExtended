     * As long as it's all the same job reserving the animal (sourceInd) it works out fine.
     * Need to check if the target still has the desired thing because if a pawn can take the entire stack then the thing object's container is changed rather than destroyed.
     * It's when a pawn takes a partial stack that new thing objects are created and the difference is deducted from the previously existing thing's stack count.
